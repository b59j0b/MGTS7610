To become an effective communicator,   you         need to think critically about your own writing   and understand how your   audience   is   likely to react to   it.   Small   details –   such   as   the
order in which you present   information and         which verbs you choose – can make   a   lot   of   difference.
This   part of the assessment task asks you to   think critically about the   Email,   Letter and
Media   Release you   have written and to
explain the writing choices you made when   preparing them.

• Do NOT discuss the content of your Email, Letter and Media Release. 
Focus on your use of specific linguistic features. 
• Use / adapt the structure outlined in 
the “Critical Reflection Writing Guide” available on Blackboard in the Week 5 OLM. 
•             Do   NOT use   bullet   points.   Use what you   have learned about sentence   structure         and clear writing   (Week 3) to write   in
complete sentences and paragraphs.
•             Use the first-person pronoun   (“I”) with   active verbs, e.g.,
—  I began my email with … because … 
—  I wanted my audience to … So, I chose the words … .
